# BeginnerContactBook

# Problem statement: 
This is an excellent python project idea for beginners. 
Everyone uses a contact book to save contact details, including name, address, phone number, and even email address. 
This is a command-line project where you will design a contact book application that users can use to save and find contact details. 
The application should also allow users to update contact information, delete contacts, and list saved contacts. 
The SQLite database is the ideal platform for saving contacts.Â
